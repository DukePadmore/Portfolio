        <p className='about__desc'>
          Hi ! My name is Duke and I am a French web developer who recently
          moved to Canada. After almost 10 years of experience in Retail and
          Procurement, I decided to transition to a new career in a field that
          has fascinated me for many years now: Web Development.
        </p>
        <p className='about__desc'>
          After months of self-studying, I joined an intensive 6-months
          Fullstack JavaScript training program at École O'Clock (Paris, France)
          in 2022. I was able to learn the key technical skills every modern web
          developer needs. I am now ready to take on new and exciting challenges
          as a web developer and I am confident that my curiosity, my passion
          and my soft & hard skills will be a great addition to your team !
        </p>
        <p className='about__desc'>
          With a strong interest for anything related to front-end, my goal is
          to create intuitive, carefully designed websites and to hone my skills
          in the process.
