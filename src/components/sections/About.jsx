          Hi ! My name is Duke and I am a French junior developer that recently
          moved to Canada. After almost 10 years of experience in Retail and
          Procurement, I decided to transition to a new career in a field that
          has fascinated me for many years now: Web Development.
        </p>
        <p className='about__desc'>
          Thanks to an intensive 6-months Fullstack JavaScript program at Ã‰cole
          O'Clock (Paris, France) in 2022, I was able to learn the key technical
          skills every modern web developer needs. I am now ready to take on new
          and exciting challenges as a web developer and even though I still
          have a lot to learn, I am confident that my curiosity, my passion and
          my skills will be a great addition to your team !
        </p>
        <p className='about__desc'>
          With a strong interest for anything related to front-end, my goal is
          to create intuitive, carefully designed websites, and to learn (a lot)
          in the process.
        </p>
