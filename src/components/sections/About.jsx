      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi ! My name is Duke and I am a French web developer living in Canada.
        After almost 10 years of experience in Retail and Procurement, I decided
        to transition to a new career in a field that has fascinated me for as
        long as I can remember: Web Development. Thanks to an intensive 6-months
        Fullstack JavaScript program at Ã‰cole O'Clock (Paris, France), I am now
        ready to take on new challenges as a web developer in Canada. With a
        strong interest for anything related to front-end, my goal is to create
        intuitive, carefully designed websites.
      </p>
